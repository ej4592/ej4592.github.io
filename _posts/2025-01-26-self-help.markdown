With the New Year swing just about in full force, many people are diving headfirst into resolutions, determined to become the best version of themselves because it's common wisdom that the date changing will lead to your life magically becoming better. And what better way to start a new habit like reading than picking up a self-help book, right? Pulling back the veil of optimism reveals the self-help industry as nothing more than a marketplace for insecurities, peddling magic-bullet promises wrapped in repackaged clichés and pop psychology. If anything, reading self-help is probably one of the least effective ways to grow—unless, of course, your goal is to line the wallets of influencers like David Goggins and Jocko Willink.

These so-called gurus profit off your dissatisfaction, somehow turning common sense into a high-value commodity. In reality, if self improvement is your goal, just pick up a book on something that genuinely interests you and start reading. Whether it’s philosophy, science, or even the latest romantasy novel, real growth comes from challenging your mind, immersing yourself in new ideas, and actually enjoying the process—not mindlessly consuming another round of motivational fluff.

## The Illusion of Productivity  

> "Nothing good ever came easy."

This is a truth that self-help books acknowledge but conveniently sidestep—because, let’s be honest, reading a self-help book is easy and if you've read one of them you've read all of them. Instead of embracing the difficulty of real growth, they package change as an effortless, step-by-step process. They make you feel productive without requiring actual effort. You highlight a few lines, nod in agreement at advice you already know—"wake up early," "be more disciplined," "network with important people"—and convince yourself you’re making progress.

But here’s the catch: knowing does not mean internalizing. Reading self-help is getting off on the idea of improving yourself rather than actually improving yourself. You get a dopamine hit from consuming the information, but nothing actually changes. There's absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying what you read, but the irony-laden, predatory nature of self-help books is what makes them insufferable. You still haven’t written that book, started that business, or learned that skill. You’ve just consumed another round of feel-good advice that vanishes the moment life actually tests you.

## The Self-Help Trap: A Life of Constant Inadequacy  

Self-help culture isn’t just misleading—it's become a festering wound on society. The entire industry is built on the premise that *you are never enough*. No matter what you achieve, no matter how much you improve, there will always be another book, another seminar, another “elite mindset hack” to unlock.

At its core, self-help sells the idea that happiness, success, and fulfillment are always *one more self-improvement cycle away*. But here’s the thing: the people selling you this dream are often the ones moving the goalposts. One moment, it’s just innocously about confidence and self-love. Then, it’s about financial freedom. Then, it’s about “escaping the matrix” and achieving some perverted abstraction of high-value through paying a guru to do push-ups in an empty parking lot with other aspiring high-value men.

But ask yourself—who really benefits from this endless cycle of inadequacy? The reader looking for genuine self-improvement? Or the influencers and authors who keep cashing in on their audiences' dissatisfaction?

It’s one thing to want to improve. Growth is important. But the industry rarely frame it that way. They don’t just encourage improvement; they commodify *insecurity*. They sell a lifestyle where you’re never allowed to be content. Where “making it” is always a moving target. There's no limit to the number in your bank, cronies in your squad, or hoes on your roster that will ever make you content.

## Jocko Willink wakes up early but does that make him a better teacher than someone like Alexandre Dumas?  

Let's investigate Jocko Willink who's not as nearly egregiously predatory as someone like Tate. The guy wakes up at 4 am, works out a lot, and was a navy seal. That’s impressive. But does that really justify an entire bookshelf of NYT best sellers most likely written by a squad of ghost-writers armed with generative AI? Golly gee, I can't wait to hear about how invigorating and difficult his cold plunge session was.

At some point, reading self-help can be a vice in and of itself. The core message—be tougher, work harder, push through—could be summed up in a paragraph.

Now compare that to fiction. If you want to internalize resilience, read *The Count of Monte Cristo*. Spend over a thousand pages *experiencing* Dantès’ suffering, patience, and transformation. His story doesn’t just tell you to be resilient—it makes you *feel* it. When life tests you, you don’t recall a bullet point from a self-help book. You recall *him*.

## Fiction Teaches More Than Discipline  

Self-help books overemphasize discipline and motivation, as if they’re the only qualities that matter. But life isn’t just about grinding harder. There are countless other lessons—compassion, forgiveness, adaptability, self-awareness—that get ignored in the “3 workdays in 1” (IYKYK) mindset.

Fiction teaches these lessons naturally. *To Kill a Mockingbird* doesn’t just tell you about courage—it *shows* you through Atticus Finch’s quiet defiance. *Les Misérables* doesn’t summarize redemption in a neat list—it makes you *live* Jean Valjean’s transformation. These stories embed wisdom in emotions, struggles, and choices, making them stick in a way no self-help book ever could.

## Why Fiction Sticks and Self-Help Fades  

When was the last time a self-help book truly changed the way you see the world? Now think about a novel that left a lasting impact. That’s the difference.

Fiction works because it engages your emotions, imagination, and empathy. Studies suggest reading fiction enhances emotional intelligence—your brain treats the character’s experiences as if they were your own. That’s why someone who reads *Crime and Punishment* understands guilt and redemption more deeply than someone who skimmed a chapter on “forgiving yourself.”

Self-help books give you a dopamine hit of motivation. Fiction changes how you think. One sells the illusion of growth. The other *actually* shapes you.

If you want to learn about resilience, discipline, or the human condition—put down the self-help books and pick up a novel. The lessons will last longer than any motivational mantra ever could.

## Read for Pleasure Too!  

Reading is one of the best hobbies you can have, and it doesn’t have to be “intellectual” to be valuable. Whether you’re diving into *Crime and Punishment* or flipping through *Diary of a Wimpy Kid*, reading for pleasure is *good*, full stop. Books don’t have to be difficult to be worth reading, and there’s nothing wrong with picking up something purely because you enjoy it. With technology overuse destroying our attention spans, sitting down and sticking to a book is probably one of the healthier things we can do for our brains.

The problem isn’t “easy” books—it’s self-help books pretending they aren’t. They market themselves as deep, instructional, and life-changing, but they rarely contain more substance than a children’s picture book. If you’re reading *Diary of a Wimpy Kid*, you know exactly what you’re getting: a fun, lighthearted story. If you pick up a fantasy novel, you expect to be entertained and immersed in another world. But self-help books? They lure you in with the promise of transformation, of profound wisdom—only to deliver surface-level advice wrapped in fluff.

At least with an actual textbook, you walk away with real knowledge. But self-help books? You walk away with vague affirmations and the lingering feeling that you *should* be doing more, without any concrete tools to make that happen.

## If You Actually Want to Learn and Self-Discipline, Read Real Non-Fiction  

While fiction helps you internalize deep truths, non-fiction is essential if you actually want to learn something new and challenge yourself. But not that watered-down, pop-science crap that promise to rewire your brain or explain the universe overnight—the real, rigorous stuff.

If you want to understand more about how the world works, pick up any introductory college physics or math textbook and start working through the chapters and problems. Not only will you actually learn something, getting through *Introduction to Linear Algebra* is bound to make you more effective, whatever that means, than finishing *7 Habits of Highly Effective People*.

## Conclusion and Caveats  

Reading is self-help. In this modern era laden with constant technology use shortening our attention spans and overloading our dopamine receptors, I can imagine no better remedy than a book. Whatever benefits one reaps through reading a self-help book are achieved in spite of the self-help aspect, not because of it. For those hell bent on self-improvement, working your reading appetite up toward books that daunt or even bore you is a better plan than remaining in that comfortable self-help book cycle. At the end of the day, just read bro.
